**How to build Resurrection Remix for Pixel 2 (aka walleye)**

Follow instructions on below link to download RR sources.

https://github.com/ResurrectionRemix/platform_manifest

Once done. 

cd ~/rr

check for below commit. if its not there, you will get vendor mismatch error on bootup even if build fingerprint and vendor fingerprint are in sync. 

https://github.com/munchycool/rr_o_android_frameworks_base/commit/4256c66dd4fb9f98f2a16751cc8b202035a3aedf  

rm -rf external/json-c (got a compile error about files in this folder being already defined elsewhere so this folder was removed). 

You can try compiling without removing this as well, and if you get an error about it remove this folder.

We also need repos mentioned at the end as they were not synced when I synced RR from source.
